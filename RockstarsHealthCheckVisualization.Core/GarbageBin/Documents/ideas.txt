! put ranges answers in nice order (sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing, bell, curve, wave, reversed wave)

congratulate rockstar when filled out questionnaire 3x or something in that range. 

or even further gamification

advanced but maybe fun to build: remind employees in their own rythm at filling out q, based on average rythm of them filling out q's.
first because easier: option to select automated time span at which emps are reminded to fill in

when making questionnaire give option to also make template out of it

possibility of working on creating (not filling out) a questionnaire, not finish it and save to work on for later

if employee works on more project, add screen to select which project
